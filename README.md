This Streamlit app is designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on user inputs. The app loads a pre-trained SVM model and allows users to input various health parameters, including age, gender, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, resting ECG results, maximum heart rate, exercise-induced angina, oldpeak, and ST slope. After the user submits the details, the app processes the inputs and provides a prediction on whether the person has heart disease.
